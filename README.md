# 100-Days-of-Code

# Day 1 - Introduction of JAVA, JRE, JVM, WORA

* Java is platform independent because you can run on any machine irrespective of hardware or OS. but it must have JVM.
* JVM is not platform independent. JVM must be built for that particular OS.
* JVM accept only byte code not normal code .
* Java compiler convert the normal code into byte code.
* You need to specify which file to run and that file must contain main method.
* while execution, it will look for specific signature like public static void
* main will accept some parameter: String a[]
* Object-oriented
* JVM is the part of Java Runtime Environment(JRE)
* Java application is WORA Write Once Run Anywhere

# DAY 2 Variables, Data type, Literals

* Data stored permanently in database but while processing data is stored in variable temporarily.
* Java is strongly type language meaning each type of data (such as integers, characters, strings, etc.) is explicitly defined and enforced, and the compiler or interpreter checks for type errors during compilation or runtime.
* "println" will print the value and go to new line just like \n in C++.

## Data type:(2 type)
* **Primitive**
          * integers,
          * Float
          * Characters
          * Boolean
* …(talk about second type is later)

## Literals
* **0b101****== binary format== will print 5
* **0x7E**==Hex format==will print 126
* **10_00_00_000"**==will print 100000000
* Character can also be incremented.
